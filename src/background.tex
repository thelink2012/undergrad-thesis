\xchapter{Background}{}

This chapter introduces the knowledge necessary to understand this work. We first introduce concepts of profiling and instrumentation, then dive into some aspects of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM for short), and finally introduce a search engine that runs on top of the JVM. We also introduce some concepts related to Linux power governors.

\section{Instrumentation}

Software instrumentation is a technique by which auxiliary code is added to an existing computer program. Instrumentation can be performed either statically (i.e. at compile-time) or dynamically (i.e. at runtime). Static instrumentation is performed by modifying the source code or by rewriting the target binary of the application. Dynamic instrumentation is performed after the binary has been loaded into memory.

Function hooking is an instrumentation technique by which function calls are intercepted to perform additional operations before and/or after the function is invoked.

Instrumentation finds many purposes, such as in profiling, debugging, program analysis, test coverage and just-in-time compilation. A profiler, for example, might hook every function of an application to measure and report their execution times.

\section{Profiling}


% Profiling Methods https://homepages.cwi.nl/~boncz/msc/2020-ChristianStuart.pdf Section 2.2

% EXPLAIN THAT PROFILERS CAN BE STATISTICAL, INSTRUMENTATION, ETC
% PROFILERS CAN BE OF STORAGE, MEMORY, HEAP, NETWORK, ENERGY, CPU, ETC

% OTHER USES: SCHEDULER, GARBAGE COLLECTOR, JIT COMPILERS

% To sample an application

\iffalse
Profilers typically need to sample the call stack of a thread every few milliseconds. A common way to achieve this on Unix-like systems is to have an application-wide timer that notifices its expiration through a signal. The \code{SIGPROF}) signal and \code{ITIMER_PROF} timer is typically used for this purposes. Once the signal is received, the call stack is sampled, by walking on the stack of the running thread.

Since the timer is application-wide, it expires when the total CPU time consumed by threads exceeds the timer value. The signal is then received at the thread that caused the timer to expire. As such, threads that consume more CPU time are more prone to receive the profiling signal than other threads, which is aligned with the profiler's idea of sampling the CPU hungry parts of the application.

\subsection{JVM Tool Interface}

% JVMTI https://homepages.cwi.nl/~boncz/msc/2020-ChristianStuart.pdf Section 2.2.2 etc

\iffalse
Design to the JVMTI. Agents create environments, and those environments have capabilities, events, and other functionalities. Before using any capability that goes beyond the ones provided by a standard JVM, agents must add capabilities to the environment. % TODO example

There can be multiple environments

% vm phases
% Callback safe

JVMTI provides functionality to intercept all Java methods, but, as expected, that significantly degrades performance. Its documentation suggests
% Cite from docs that it doesn't include full-speed method entry/exit (maybe in introduction/methodology?)
