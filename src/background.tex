\xchapter{Background}{}

This chapter introduces background knowledge necessary to understand this work. We first introduce concepts of profiling and instrumentation, then dive into some aspects of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM for short), and finally introduce a search engine that runs on top of the JVM. We also introduce some concepts related to Linux power governors.

\section{Instrumentation}

Software instrumentation is a technique by which auxiliary code is added to an existing computer program. Instrumentation can be performed either statically (i.e. at compile-time) or dynamically (i.e. at runtime). Static instrumentation is performed by modifying the source code or by rewriting the target binary of the application. Dynamic instrumentation is performed after the binary has been loaded into memory.

Function hooking is an instrumentation technique by which function calls are intercepted to perform additional operations before and/or after the function is invoked.

Instrumentation finds many purposes, such as in profiling, debugging, program analysis, test coverage and just-in-time compilation. A profiler, for example, might hook every function of an application to measure and report their execution times.

\section{Profiling}

Software profiling is a form of dynamic program analysis used to measure performance characteristics of a computer program. A profiler can measure a range of metrics, such as execution time, memory usage and power consumption.

Profilers are typically used to identify hotpaths (i.e. code blocks where most of the application's time is spent). Once identified, these hotpaths can be improved, either manually (i.e. by a programmer) or automatically (i.e. through a algorithm). An optimizing compiler, for example, might use a profile to take more informed decisions or optimize certain functions more aggressively.

Profilers can be classified in sampling profilers, on which threads are interrupted once in a while to take samples of its execution, and in instrumenting profilers, where program's code is modified to include the reporting of statistics at key locations. Sampling profilers typically produce much lower runtime overhead than the intrumented counterpart.

\subsection{Sampling in Unix-like Systems}

Sampling profilers need to sample the call stack of a thread every few milliseconds. A common way to achieve this on Unix-like systems is to have an application-wide timer that notifices its expiration through a signal. The \code{SIGPROF} signal and \code{ITIMER_PROF} timer are typically used for this purposes. Once the signal is received, the call stack is sampled, by walking on the stack of the running thread.

%Since the timer is application-wide, it expires when the total CPU time consumed by threads exceeds the timer value. The signal is then received at the thread that caused the timer to expire. As such, threads that consume more CPU time are more prone to receive the profiling signal than other threads, which is aligned with the profiler's attempt of sampling the hotpaths of an application.

The code executed in the signal handler must be carefully crafted to be \emph{async-signal-safe}. Async-signal-safe operations are guaranteed to not interfere with operations in the interrupted thread. For example, signals may produce deadlocks if they try to hold the same locks as those held by the interrupted thread. As such, async-signal-safe code are limited to primitive memory operations and a limited subset of system calls. Given this limitation, profiling signal handlers typicallly publish the acquired samples to a separate worker thread through an async-signal-safe data structure.


\section{Java Virtual Machine}

The Java Virtual Machine is an abstract computing machine. Its primary purposes is of executing code independently of the host hardware and host operating system. This machine has an instruction set and a set of memory areas. There are several implementations of the JVM. Some in hardware (e.g. picoJava), but most of them are software based (e.g. HotSpot, J9, Zing). Oracle's HotSpot is the most popular of these implementations.

Java is an object-oriented programming language that compiles to the JVM instruction set. Java found wide popularity in the software industry due to the characteristics of the Java Virtual Machine. There are several other programming languages capable of targeting the JVM, such as Scala, Kotlin, Clojure and Jython.

\subsection{Execution Pipeline}

A program targeting the JVM is compiled into a set of class files. A class file is a binary format containing JVM instructions (or \emph{bytecode}), symbol tables and other ancillary information. Class files are loaded, linked and initialized by the JVM's \emph{class loader}.

Once classes are loaded, they are executed by the JVM. Most software implementations employ a just-in-time compiler (i.e. bytecode is compiled into the host machine instruction set as it is interpreted). The compiled code can then execute with performance characteristics comparable to that of programming languages AOT-compiled to machine code.

Just-in-time compilers may employ profile-guided optimizations. Oracle's HotSpot, for example, performs tiered compilation. It has four levels of compilation, and it optimizes and deoptimizes functions between levels as the profile of the application evolves. HotSpot's JIT constructs profiles through instrumentation of method invocations and loop backedges.

The Java Virtual Machine features automatic memory management through garbage collection. An unreachable instance of an object is automatically classified as garbage and freed from memory. The program may be suspended while garbage collection occurs, a process known as \emph{stop-the-world}.

\subsection{Java Native Interface}

The Java Native Interface (JNI) is an application-programming interface (API) that allows JVM bytecode to interopate with native machine code. This library can be used to invoke functions written in AOT-compiled programming languages such as C++ from within a Java program.

To invoke a native function from Java, a native method is declared in the Java program. Then, during class loading, the JVM binds that method to a native symbol of a dynamic link library. Listings~\ref{lst:jni_example_java} and \ref{lst:jni_example_cpp} presents an example of this interaction.

This program can be compiled into a dynamic link library e.g. \code{libqux.so} and loaded into the Java program.}]{src/listing/JNIExample.cpp}
\end{minipage}
\caption*{} % don't put in list of figures
\end{figure}

The JVM has a per-thread \emph{JNI Environment} that can be used by native functions to interact with the JVM. This environment is passed as argument to every native method invocation. The environment consists of a pointer to a function table and internal data opaque to the native code. The function table contains function pointers that can be used to interface with the JVM. Figure~\ref{fig:jni_function_table} illustrates the approach.

The JNI interface provides functionality to invoke Java methods, access object fields, create objects, create references to objects, define classes, throw exceptions, and more. All data type interaction must occur through JNI's data types which maps to Java types e.g. JNI's \code{jobject} maps to Java's \code{Object}.

\subsection{JVM Tool Interface}

The JVM Tool Interface (JVMTI) is a programming interface that can be used by native agents to build development and monitoring tools for the JVM. It provides ways to inspect states and react to events of the VM. Although a JVM implementation isn't required to support the JVMTI, most of the software implementations do.

JVMTI follows most of the approaches in JNI, such as using the same data types, and exposing its API through a function table. JVMTI environments can be created by calling JNI's \href{https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/specs/jni/invocation.html#getenv}{\code{GetEnv}} function. A native agent is compiled into a dynamic link library and loaded into the VM through command line options. The agent dynamic library should include the native symbols \code{Agent_OnLoad} and \code{Agent_OnUnload}. These functions are invoked by the VM before initialization and during termination, respectively, to offer the agent an opportunity for setup and teardown. An example agent is shown in Listing~\ref{lst:example_jvmti}.

\subsubsection*{Capabilities}

JVMTI provides several functions that can be invoked from most contexts e.g. \apijvmtiref{GetCallStackTrace} and several events that can be used to react to the VM e.g. \apijvmtiref{MethodEntry}. These functions and events may come at a cost in execution speed, start up time, and/or memory footprint. For this reason, the JVM (or JVMTI) doesn't provide by default any of these capabilities. During \code{Agent_OnLoad}, the agent must add (through JVMTI's \apijvmtiref{AddCapabilities}) the capabilities it needs (e.g. \apijvmtiref{can_generate_method_entry_events}).

\subsubsection*{Events}

In addition to capability setting, events of interest can be enabled (and disabled) by calling JVMTI's \apijvmtiref{SetEventNotificationMode}. The event's callback functions can be set with \apijvmtiref{SetEventCallbacks}. Event callbacks receive their JNI and JVMTI environments as arguments, as well as additional information related to the event.

\subsubsection*{Environment Disposal}

A JVMTI environment can be disposed explicitly by calling \apijvmtiref{DisposeEnvironment}, or implicitly during agent unloading. During disposal, the environment capabilities are automatically relinquished as well as its events disabled. Memory and any other additional resources allocated by the agent must be freed manually.

\lstinputlisting[language=C++,frame=tb,float,floatplacement=b,caption={Example of a JVMTI agent that intercepts every Java method entry. During agent setup, the JVMTI environment is created and the necessary capabilities requested. Then, the method entry event is enabled and its callbacks set. Error handling is omitted for brevity.},label=lst:example_jvmti]{src/listing/example-jvmti.cpp}.
