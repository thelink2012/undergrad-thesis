\xchapter{Programming Interface}{} \label{chap:api}

In order to use JVMTIPROF, the agent must create and inject an JVMTIPROF environment into an existing JVMTI one. This can be done through the \hyperref[api:jvmtiProf_Create]{\code{jvmtiProf_Create}} function.

Multiple JVMTIPROF environments can be injected into an JVMTI environment. Each environment retains its own state. For example, each has its own logging verbosity, configured capabilities, and registered events.

% TODO explain none of the functions is CALLBACK SAFE

%The programming interface is used to communicate with the infrastructure for profiling

%The programming interface of jvmtiprof follows the same conventions as that of JVMTI

%etc explain error codes, return values, references, prerequisite states (see jvmti docs)
